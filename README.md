# Interpretability and Satiability


This is the project of Ruoqing Yao, under the mentorship of Jiayi Lu and Dr. Judith Degen, for the 2022 Stanford CSLI summer internship program. This project is still under construction. This project is partially built upon the materials from the previous year's intern's work by Nicholas Wright which was a related satiation project. Those materials is currently also included in this repository.
