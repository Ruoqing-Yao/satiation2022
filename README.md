# Generalization of Satiation Effects


Welcome to the satiation project! This is the project of Nicholas Wright, under the mentorship of Jiayi Lu and Judith Degen, for the Stanford CSLI summer internship program.

You can find in this repository all the experimental materials, data, and analysis scripts for the 2022 CogSci conference paper "Satiation effects generalize across island types". Experiments 1 and 2 in the paper corresponds to Exp.1c and 2 in this repo respectively. The data and analysis scripts can be found in the "Analysis" folder.

This project uses web-based psycholinguistics experiments to investigate satiation effects of island-violating sentences: with exposure, acceptability ratings of island sentences increases. We're looking at satiation as an instance of linguistic adaptation, where comprehenders update their expectations about the linguistic signal in their environment. In particular, this projects aims to locate the representational targets of satiation-as-adaptation: which features of islands do comprehenders track? Is it a given island type's (whether island, subject island) specific structure? Or is it something more general, like filler-gap dependecies? We investigate this by testing for generalization of satiation from one sentence type to the other; if exposure to one kind of sentence raises the acceptability ratings of another kind of sentence, then comprehenders might be tracking some feature common to both sentence types.
